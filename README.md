# Library Book Manager

This project is part of my *System Design Practice* course during undergraduation studies. It is an android application that helps students in borrowing books from library and return it back on time with appropriate reminders on specific intervals.

The project is an Android application that uses MySQL to host data on the remote server and interacts with the database using PHP scripts which fetches the data in JSON.
